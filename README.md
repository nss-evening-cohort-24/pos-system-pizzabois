#HipHop Pizza & Wangz POS system
This is a POS (point of sale) system that allows a user to easily create, read, update, and delete orders while storing information such as: 
- order items
- order price
- revenue from all orders


#Motivation
We wanted to create an app that was user friendly that allowed the creation and manipulation of data that could be utilized in a fast paced food service environment. 
High stress and volume is common in food service, so a clean and concise UI was our intention with this app. A clear way to navigate to any order or page is necessary to maintain efficiency in an environment like that.
